# ScamChain

ScamChain is a DAO to build an on-chain record of scammer addresses and the wallets 
compromised by them.  It is composed of three Tokens:

* SCAM - An ERC 721 non-fungible token that is sent to a scammer address as a result of a 
  compromise.  The accumulation of SCAM tokens is an indicator of the frequency with which a 
  particular ETH address is associated with scamming.  SCAM tokens can only be generated on 
  a one-to-one correspondence with COMP tokens.  SCAM tokens carry within them immutably
  the address of the original scam address so that sending them to another address does not
  change their point of origin.
* COMP - An ERC 721 non-fungible token that is generated by an ETH address to create a 
  record of a scamming incident.  The accumulation of COMP tokens is an indicator of the 
  frequency with which a particular ETH address reports scamming incidents.  COMP tokens
  carry within them the address which was compromised and collectively identify all 
  addresses which have been publicly reported to have been compromised.
* WATCH - An ERC 20 governance token that forms the backbone of a governance DAO which 
  allows voting for community responses to scammers.  It may be possible, for example,
  for exchanges and other blockchain services to blacklist addresses which accumulate a
  sufficient number of SCAM tokens.
